# --------------------------RGB------------------------------------ #

- We can use color name
- Or use rgb(255, 0, 0)
- we can overrite one color over another 
body{
    color : white;
}
p{
    color: black;
}
- Black is taken as it is wrtten inside p more specific
- We also have rgba(0,0,0,1) ---> a is opacity here it is black with full opacity


# --------------------------------Hexadecimal --------------------------------- #

- color: #000000 ----> black
- color: #FFFFFF ----> white
- two decimals for red next for green next for blue same as rgb
- if two decimal match rather than 6, we can use 3 i.e for #000000 is #000

# There is also hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
